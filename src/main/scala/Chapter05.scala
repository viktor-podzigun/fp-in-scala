    * Exercise 5.1
    *
    * Write a function to convert a `Stream` to a `List`, which will force its evaluation
    * and let you look at it in the REPL. You can convert to the regular `List` type
    * in the standard library.
    * You can place this and other functions that operate on a `Stream` inside the `Stream` trait.
