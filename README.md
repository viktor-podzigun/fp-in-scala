### Functional Programming in Scala
My solutions to the exercises from the excellent book [Functional Programming in Scala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)

1. What is functional programming?
2. [Getting started](src/main/scala/Chapter02.scala) => [tests](src/test/scala/Chapter02Spec.scala)
3. [Functional data structures](src/main/scala/Chapter03.scala) => [tests](src/test/scala/Chapter03Spec.scala)

Almost all solutions are covered with corresponding tests.
You can build and run tests and see the coverage by using the following command:

```bash
sbt clean coverage test coverageReport
```
